# Status
Still in progress. (Currently working on a basic folder (files) comparison first, which would help when trying to see which files you updated/copied or not.)

# MinecraftLekkerModpackBuilder
An application that can help you build or maintain your own modpacks, based on what I would like in such a tool. Not to replace apps like Prismlauncher, but to cater for wanted features not provided by it.
